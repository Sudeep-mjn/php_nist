1. Project Overview
This project aims to develop an admin panel for a website that allows administrators to manage notices and activities. The admin panel will be built using PHP for the backend, MySQL for the database, and HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations will be implemented for both notices and activities sections. The frontend of the website should remain unaffected, with changes only impacting the admin panel.
2. Key Features
Admin Authentication
Login: Admins can log in using a username and password.
Logout: Admins can log out of the system.
Notice Management
Create Notice: Admins can create new notices with a title, description, and date.
Read Notices: Admins can view all notices in a list format.
Update Notice: Admins can edit existing notices.
Delete Notice: Admins can delete notices.
Frontend Display: Notices should be displayed on the frontend with a "Read More" option for longer descriptions.
Activity Management
Create Activity: Admins can create new activities with a title, description, image, and link.
Read Activities: Admins can view all activities in a list format.
Update Activity: Admins can edit existing activities.
Delete Activity: Admins can delete activities.
Frontend Display: Activities should be displayed on the frontend with an image, title, and a brief description. The full description should be accessible via a link.
User Interface
Admin Dashboard: A clean and intuitive dashboard for managing notices and activities.
Responsive Design: The admin panel should be responsive and work well on different screen sizes.
